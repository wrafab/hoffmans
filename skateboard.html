<h1>SKATEBOARD (Or Vacuum Forming and Lamination)</h1>

<p>I do not skateboard. I have no use for a skateboard. But I had to make one, so now I have one.</p>

<p>The process wasn't too hard. Just carve an image with Corel and then glue everything together. Sure, the glue didn't stick the boards together perfectly, and the edges are uneven, but it turned out all right.</p>

<p>And now I have a skateboard with Pickle Rick on it.</p>
