<p> Perhaps the project I was looking forward to the most, the T-Shirt was really fun to make. Learning how to photoshop images was interesting. I decdided to make a shirt for the Super Smash Bros. series. </p>
<p> I started by using an image of a standard stadium. Then, I found images of some of my favorite characters from the game.</p>
	<p>I superimposed them over the stage image. Finally, I exported it to the T-Shirt programmer and printed it out. And now I have an awesome new T-Shirt. </p>
