<p> I had to create a box for this project, so I decided to make something to hold my ticket stubs in after I've seen movies. Holding up pretty well. </p>

<p> For my next trick: a set of pieces that, when fitted together, don't fall apart! </p>

<p> And then I had a few options and had to pick two. First: a bookmark with some of my favorite fantasy protagonists, listed as follows:
      Frodo Baggins from Lord of the Rings;
      Harry Potter from Harry Potter;
      Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister, and Daenerys Targaryen from A Song of Ice and Fire;
      Eragon from the Inheritance cycle;
      and finally, Jack from The Magic Treehouse. </p>

<p> And finally, for my other option, a coaster for drinks bearing the symbol of water from Avatar: The Last Airbender. </p>
