<h1>RASPBERRY PI</h1>

<p>Oh goodie. More coding. As you could probably guess, my experience with Raspberry Pi was not the best.</p>

<p>I managed to get one picture of something I coded, but did not send or copy the videos and photos from my desktop to my actual computer.</p>
<br>
<p>I learned that physical computing is not something I want to do because it is really really hard and not fun at all.</p>
<p>It requires these programs called Scratch and Python to work and code images and stuff, which we used for taking pictures with a camera.</p>
<br>
<p>I honestly cannot say if I have a favorite Raspberry Pi project, because I thought the entire thing was one long project. I guess figuring out how to code patterns onto that little square of lights was pretty fun. I got to spell out my name in Morse Code.</p>
