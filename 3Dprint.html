<h1> THE COASTER </h1>

<p> For the 3D image I tried to create, I attempted to make a lampshade for the lamp in my room. However, it ended up getting printed way too small. </p>

<p> However, it turns out that the smaller size works as a drink holder. But be warned: the curved bottom makes most glasses difficult to hold, so it would be wise to use it for either cans or large-bottomed cups. </p>
  <p> Sidenote: it turns out the pictures are sideways, so keep that in mind while viewing. </p>
